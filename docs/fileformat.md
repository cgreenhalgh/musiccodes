# MusicCodes Experience Fileformat

The initial standalone proof of concept loads the default experience file `server/public/example.json`. The wordpress plugin-based version loads the experience from wordpress.

Single top-level JSON object with properties:
- `parameters` - map of parameter name/value
- `markers` - list of `marker` objects

## `parameters`:

(added 2015-12-14)

- `streamGap` (float, seconds, default 2.0), maximum gap between note onsets that are considered part of the same note stream by the default stream classifier
- `frequencyRatio` (float, ratio, default 2.05), maximum pitch/frequency ratio between a note and the first note of a stream group for the new note to be considered part of the same note stream by the default stream classifier.
- `vampParameters` - map of VAMP plugin parameters, default (for silvet plugin) `mode` = `0` (live), `instrument` = `0` (various/unknown).

not yet implemented:
- `vampPlugin` (string, default `silvet:silvet`), vamp feature extraction plugin to use


##Â `marker`
/
This is based on ArtCodes/Aestheticodes file format, pre November 2015.

Object with properties:
- `code` (string, required, no default), code associated with this marker/action - see below
- `showDetail` (boolean, default ?), when code is detected show title prompt (`true`) or trigger action immediately (`false`)
- `action` (string, URL), the action, e.g. target page to load, when code is detected
- `title` (string), title of the action in showDetail view
- `description` (string), description of the action in showDetail view (not currently used)
- `image` (string, URL), icon of the action in showDetail view

## `code`

As of 25/11/2015 there are two code formats.

### Code format 1

Format 1 (from original demo) builds codes from the note names, in the order they are detected, without timing information. E.g. `"B5A5G5"` corresponds to a note stream which ends with a `B5` (i.e. B in octave 5), `A5` then `G5`. These codes are only checked after the note stream has ended, i.e. after the `streamGap` with the default classifier.

### Code format 2

Format 2 builds codes from relative interval and timing the immediately preceeding notes. E.g. `"0(4),0"` corresponds to two consecutive notes of the same pitch, decomposing the string as follows:
- `0` - pitch offset of first note being considered relative to last note, in semitones = `0`, i.e. same pitch
- `(4)` - duration of time interval between that note and the next note, normalised so that the last interval is considered `4` (i.e. 4 beats)
- `,` - next note...
- `0` - last note is always considered to be pitch `0` and length unspecified.

E.g. `"4(4),2(4),0"` is a sequence of (at least) 3 notes, where the last 3 notes have the same time interval between them (i.e. the first and second notes have the same duration) and there the pitch of each note is one tone below the previous one.

Note that format 2 checks for codes after every note and does not wait for the 'end' of a note stream, so the note pattern can be embedded within a longer stream of notes.
